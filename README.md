# calculator-challenge
1. Intro:
In this challenge I designed and created a basic calculator. This calculator can add, subtract, divide and multiply.

2. Tools:

To complete this project, I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript and I used Sass to separate my styling into clear sections. Examples of these include my colour variables and my typography.

3. Method:

I started off by give the buttons specific names and classes using the BEM naming convention which then helped to divide them into number and operator buttons. I also gave each button a specific value that I could then target in my JavaScript. 

3a. Displaying the numbers:

I selected the relevant button/buttons using document.querySelector and then used a forEach function to loop through each button. Within the forEach fucntion, I used .addEventListener to define clicking on the particular button/buttons as an event which would target button value and display this by modifying the HTML element.

3b. Storing the sums:
